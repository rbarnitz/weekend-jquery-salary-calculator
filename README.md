Duration: Weekend Project

What problem did you solve? How did you solve it?

The biggest problem (or most time-consuming) was clearing my input fields after hitting submit. I tried several methods that didn't work, but found out I needed to declare new varables for those text fields. I could probably do this better by assigning certain classes to buttons and targeting all of them.
